# Password Cracking Simulation

## Objective
The **Password Cracking Simulation** project demonstrates the process of cracking passwords using dictionary and brute-force attacks. This tool educates on the importance of strong password policies by showing the effectiveness of various cracking techniques and visualizing time taken based on password complexity.

## Features
- Simulate a dictionary attack using John the Ripper.
- Implement a brute-force attack in Python to showcase password vulnerabilities.
- Visualize cracking times for different password strengths.
- Generate reports to analyze password strength and the efficiency of different cracking techniques.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: For running brute-force attack scripts and visualization.
- **John the Ripper**: A fast password cracker for dictionary attacks.
- **Hashcat**: Another powerful tool for password recovery.

## Directory Structure
- `/scripts`: Contains Python scripts for brute-force password cracking and visualization.
- `/config`: Holds configuration files for John the Ripper.
- `/reports`: Stores generated reports on password strength and cracking analysis.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavanaa02/Password-Cracking-Simulation.git
